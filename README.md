# Domain Streamlit App

This repository contains a simple Streamlit application. The app showcases how to use `requests` and the `googlesearch` library to fetch information from the web and display it through a Streamlit interface.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

Execute the Streamlit application from the repository root with:

```bash
streamlit run mainia.py
```

This command launches the web interface in your default browser. Any interaction or search performed by the app will be displayed there.
